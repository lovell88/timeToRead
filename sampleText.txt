Alma 57:16-21

16) And now, in those critical circumstances, it became a very serious
matter to determine concerning these prisoners of war; nevertheless, 
we did resolve to send them down to the land of Zarahemla; therefore 
we selected a part of our men, and gave them charge over our prisoners 
to go down to the land of Zarahemla.

17) But it came to pass that on the morrow they did return. And now 
behold, we did not inquire of them concerning the prisoners; for behold, 
the Lamanites were upon us, and they returned in season to save us 
from falling into their hands. For behold, Ammoron had sent to their 
support a new supply of provisions and also a numerous army of men.

18) And it came to pass that those men whom we sent with the prisoners 
did arrive in season to check them, as they were about to overpower us.

19) But behold, my little band of two thousand and sixty fought most 
desperately; yea, they were firm before the Lamanites, and did administer 
death unto all those who opposed them.

20) And as the remainder of our army were about to give way before the 
Lamanites, behold, those two thousand and sixty were firm and undaunted.

21) Yea, and they did obey and observe to perform every word of command 
with exactness; yea, and even according to their faith it was done unto 
them; and I did remember the words which they said unto me that their 
mothers had taught them.
